    <h4>Library Use</h4>

    <p>Huie Library may be used by any community patron. Any person under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.
        <em>Usage of the library by members of the community is not a right, but a privilege that may be
            revoked.</em>
    </p>

    <h4>Getting a Library Card</h4>

    <p>Community patrons, including HSU graduates, may apply for a Henderson State University library card. To qualify,
        you must be a resident of Arkansas and provide proof of your mailing address. Patrons under 18 must also have a
        parent's signature (see more information below). There is a $5.00 charge for the card and a $5.00 charge for any
        replacements. HSU graduates do not pay the initial $5.00 charge, but all other policies and charges apply.
        Please visit the library to fill out an application.</p>

    <h4>General Policy</h4>

    <p>To check out any item or to use the community computers you must have your card. We do not look up accounts or
        use alternate means of identification. This is for your protection. The account holder will be held responsible
        for any material checked out on the account. Do not lend your card to others. Report lost or stolen cards as
        soon as possible.</p>

    <h4>Minor Card Policy</h4>

    <p>Patrons under 18 must have a parent/guardian fill out and sign the Huie Library Minor Card application. By
        signing the application you acknowledge and agree that you as a parent/guardian will review
        all materials your minor will check out or view in Huie Library. If the terms of the application are not
        acceptable, you as a parent/guardian may still check out materials under your library account for your minor. It
        will be a considered a violation of policy if the minor uses the parent/guardian library card
        to check out material at Huie Library and result in revoking the parent/guardian library card.</p>

    <p>To qualify, parent/guardian and minor must be a resident of Arkansas and provide proof of your mailing address.
        There is a $5.00 charge for the card and a $5.00 charge for any replacements. Please visit the library to fill
        out an application.</p>

    <p>Minor Card Policy applies to HSU/OBU dependents as well. OBU dependents must have the Huie Library Minor Card
        application on file.
    </p>

    <p>Huie Library cannot provide access to OverDrive's Libby or Computers for minor accounts.</p>

    <h4>Overdue Items, Billing, and Replacement Charges</h4>

        billing statement that is generated. Replacement charges for lost or damaged material will be a minimum of
        $50.00 or the price of the item - whichever is greater.</p>
