    <h2>Community Computer Use Policy</h2>

    <p>In order to enhance and support its mission to provide information resources and research assistance in pursuit
        of scholarly and creative endeavors, Huie Library provides computers and internet access for
        Henderson State University students, faculty, staff, and community library cardholders.</p>

    <h4>Community Computer Use</h4>

    <p>As a service to the community, two computers, located near the Circulation Desk, are provided for
        community use with the following guidelines:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In order to use the community computers, a patron must have a valid Huie Library Community card. For
            instructions on obtaining a card, please see our <a

            the Circulation desk to obtain a username. </li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Misuse</h4>

    <h4>Content</h4>

    <p>Huie Library does not censor its resources. The library is responsible only for the content of those pages
        bearing its name. The library is not responsible for the accuracy of information found on the internet. Patrons
        should evaluate sites for content and accuracy.</p>

    <p>Note: In compliance with Arkansas state law, Community Patrons under the age of 18 cannot use Huie Library's
        computers.</p>
