	<h2>Community Computer Use Policy</h2>

	<p>In order to enhance and support its mission to provide information resources and research assistance in pursuit
		of scholarly and creative endeavors, Huie Library provides computers for both work and internet access for
		Henderson State University students, faculty, staff, and community library cardholders.</p>

	<h4>Community Computer Use</h4>

	<p>As a service to the community, two computers, which are located near the Circulation Desk, are provided for
		community use with the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>In order to use the community computers, a patron must have a valid Huie Library Community card. For
			instructions on obtaining a card, please see our <a
				href="/academics/huie-library/about-us/mission-and-policies/community-patron-policy/"
				rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Patron Policies</a>.</li>
		<li>As of May 2021, community patrons must present community card before each computer session, and sign in at
			the Circulation desk with name, date, and time.</li>
		<li>Community patrons are limited to two hours of computer use per day.</li>
		<li>If all computers are in use, a community patron seeking to use a computer may ask to be put on a waiting
			list for the next available computer.</li>
		<li>Community computers are available on a first-come, first-serve basis and cannot be reserved for specific
			times.</li>
		<li>Community computers are available from the opening of the library until ten minutes prior closing.</li>
		<li>Printing is available from the community computers for 5 cents per page. Please pick up and pay for prints
			at the Circulation Desk. Community patrons may also purchase color prints for $0.50 by bringing their
			prepared files on a flash drive to the Reference Desk. For more information, please see our <a
				href="/academics/huie-library/about-us/mission-and-policies/printing-policy/"
				rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Printing Policy</a>.</li>
		<li>At the librarian's discretion, a community patron pursuing coursework may be logged onto a Student computer.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Computer and Internet Access</h4>

	<p>Access to the computers and the Internet is a privilege and not a right, and access to both is to be available
		equally to the entire HSU community. Misuse of computers will result in revocation of Internet and computer
		privileges. Access is on a first-come, first-serve basis with no reservation or advance signups required. Misuse
		includes but is not limited to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Attempting to override computer system security</li>
		<li>Destruction of or damage to equipment, data, or software</li>
		<li>Disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communication</li>
		<li>Harassment of others</li>
		<li>Reconfiguring workstations</li>
		<li>Signing into more than one computer at a time</li>
		<li>Signing others, including family members, onto computers</li>
		<li>Use of accounts or network identification assigned to others</li>
		<li>Violation of another's privacy</li>
		<li>Violation of software license agreements</li>
	</ul>
	<h4> </h4>

	<p>Huie Library does not censor its resources. The library is responsible only for the content of those pages
		bearing its name. The library is not responsible for the accuracy of information found on the Internet. Patrons
		should evaluate sites for content and accuracy.</p>

	<p>Note: Patrons under the age of 18 cannot use Huie Library's computers because of Arkansas Law.</p>

	<p>This policy is subject to change without notice.</p>
