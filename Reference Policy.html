                    <h4>What is Huie VirtualRef?</h4>

                    <p>Huie VirtualRef, an extension of traditional library reference service, is a Chat Reference
                        service, which allows patrons to quickly and conveniently ask questions of librarians and other
                        reference staff. This service is provided for Henderson State University students, faculty, and
                        staff. Students enrolled in Henderson's off-campus or online courses are encouraged to use
                        VirtualRef. Other users are welcome to use the service for questions that deal specifically with
                        the university or the library and its collections. For more information on using this service,
                        please see our <a href="/academics/huie-library/ask-a-librarian/huie-libchat-virtual-reference/"
