    <p>In order to enhance and support its mission to provide information resources and research assistance in pursuit
        of scholarly and creative endeavors, Huie Library provides computers and internet access for
        Henderson State University students, faculty, staff, and community library cardholders.</p>

    <h4>Student Computer Use</h4>

    <p>In our ongoing effort to provide students with the resources they need, Huie Library provides over 75 student
        computers throughout the library. While most of the computers are located on the first floor, there are a number
        located on the quieter second and third floors. To use a computer, a student simply needs to log on with their
        University username and password. First time login information is your University username (aa123456) and the
        password is the first four digits of your birthday and last four digits of your social security number. If you
        have forgotten your password, please contact the Help Desk at 870-230-5678.</p>

    <p>Printing is available from any student computer in the library. For more information on printing in the library
        and student Account Balances, please see our <a
            href="/academics/huie-library/about-us/mission-and-policies/printing-policy/"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Printing Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that some computer workstations are set up to be used with specific technology (for example -
        scanners and microfilm readers) and are not meant for general work or internet access. These computers are
        clearly marked, and any students using the computer and not the attached equipment may be asked to move to
        another computer if someone needs to use the equipment.</p>

    <h4>Faculty and Staff Computer Use</h4>

    <p>Due to university network restrictions, Faculty and Staff are not able to log onto the public and student
        computers in Huie Library. If you are Faculty or Staff and would like to use a computer in the library, please
        visit the Ciculation Desk, and a library staff member will log you onto a computer.</p>

    <h4>Intellectual Freedom</h4>

    <p>Huie Library supports the position of the American Library Association (ALA) with respect to the principles of
        intellectual freedom. Those principles are encapsulated in the Library Bill of Rights, which asserts that the
        censorship of library materials violates the library's obligation to provide information and enlightenment to
        all users and that libraries must resist efforts to abridge the rights of free expression and free access to
        ideas, as protected by the First Amendment.</p>

    <h4>Content</h4>

    <p>The library neither selects nor controls the contents of internet sites. The library is responsible only for the
        content of those pages bearing its name. The library is not responsible for the accuracy of information found on
        the internet. Patrons should evaluate sites for content and accuracy. Patrons should be aware that most internet
        materials are copyrighted and existing copyright laws govern their use. Some resources may be offensive to
        some patrons.</p>

    <h4>Misuse</h4>

    <p>Access to the computers and the Internet is a privilege and not a right. Misuse of computers will result in
        revocation of internet and computer
        privileges. Misuse includes but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Accessing illegal material</li>
        <li>Attempting to override computer system security</li>
        <li>Destruction of or damage to equipment, data, or software</li>
        <li>Disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communication</li>
        <li>Harassment, threatening, or intimidation of others</li>
        <li>Reconfiguring workstations</li>
        <li>Signing into more than one computer at a time</li>
        <li>Signing others, including family members, onto computers</li>
        <li>Use of accounts or network identification assigned to others</li>
        <li>Violation of another's privacy</li>
        <li>Violation of copyright or software license agreements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, anyone using the computers in Huie Library must comply with the University's Technology Usage
        Guidelines.</p>

    <p>Note: In compliance with Arkansas Act 1533 of 2001, patrons under the age of 18 will have internet privileges
        suspended if using public terminals to access sexually explicit websites. Repeat offenses will result in
        revocation of internet privileges.</p>

    <p>This policy is subject to change without notice.</p>
