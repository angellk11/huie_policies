	<h2>Student Computer Use Policy</h2>

	<h4><strong>Student Computer Use Policy</strong></h4>

	<p>In order to enhance and support its mission to provide information resources and research assistance in pursuit
		of scholarly and creative endeavors, Huie Library provides computers for both work and internet access for
		Henderson State University students, faculty, staff, and community library cardholders.</p>

	<p><strong>Intellectual Freedom</strong></p>

	<p>Huie Library supports the position of the American Library Association (ALA) with respect to the principles of
		intellectual freedom. Those principles are encapsulated in the Library Bill of Rights, which asserts that the
		censorship of library materials violates the libraryâ€™s obligation to provide information and enlightenment to
		all users and that libraries must resist efforts to abridge the rights of free expression and free access to
		ideas, as protected by the First Amendment. </p>

	<p>The library neither selects nor controls the contents of Internet sites. The library is responsible only for the
		content of those pages bearing its name. The library is not responsible for the accuracy of information found on
		the Internet. Patrons should evaluate sites for content and accuracy. Patrons should be aware that most Internet
		materials are copyrighted and existing copyright laws govern their use. Selected resources may be offensive to
		some patrons; parents are responsible for their children's use of the Internet.</p>

	<p><strong>Student Computer Use</strong></p>

	<p>In our ongoing effort to provide students with the resources they need, Huie Library provides over 75 student
		computers throughout the library. While most of the computers are located on the first floor, there are a number
		located on the quieter second and third floors. To use a computer, a student simply needs to log on with their
		University username and password. First time login information is your University username (aa123456) and the
		password is the first four digits of your birthday and last four digits of your social security number. If you
		have forgotten your password, please contact the CCS HelpDesk at 870-230-5678.</p>

	<p>Printing is available from any student computer in the library. For more information on printing in the library
		and student Account Balances, please see our <a
			href="/academics/huie-library/about-us/mission-and-policies/printing-policy/"
			rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Printing Policy</a>.</p>

	<p>Please be aware that some computer workstations are set up to be used with specific technology (for example -
		scanners and microfilm readers) and are not meant for general work or internet access. These computers are
		clearly marked, and any students using the computer and not the attached equipment may be asked to move to
		another computer if someone needs to use the equipment.</p>

	<p><strong>Faculty and Staff Computer Use</strong></p>

	<p>Due to university network restrictions, Faculty and Staff are not able to log onto the public and student
		computers in Huie Library. If you are Faculty or Staff and would like to use a computer in the library, please
		visit the Reference Desk on the first floor, and a library staff member will log you onto a computer.</p>

	<p><strong>Computer and Internet Access</strong></p>

	<p>Access to the computers and the Internet is a privilege and not a right, and access to both is to be available
		equally to the entire HSU community. Misuse of computers will result in revocation of Internet and computer
		privileges. Access is on a first-come, first-served basis with no reservation or advance signups required.
		Misuse includes but is not limited to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Accessing child-pornography sites </li>
		<li>Attempting to override computer system security</li>
		<li>Destruction of or damage to equipment, data, or software</li>
		<li>Disruption or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communication</li>
		<li>Harassment of others</li>
		<li>Physically damaging computers</li>
		<li>Reconfiguring workstations</li>
		<li>Signing into more than one computer at a time</li>
		<li>Signing others, including family members, onto computers</li>
		<li>Use of accounts or network identification assigned to others</li>
		<li>Using library computers with the intention of threatening, intimidating or invading the privacy of others
		</li>
		<li>Violation of another's privacy</li>
		<li>Violation of copyright or software license agreements</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In addition, anyone using the computers in Huie Library must comply with the University's Technology Usage
		Guidelines.</p>

	<p>Note: In compliance with Arkansas Act 1533 of 2001, patrons under the age of 18 will have Internet privileges
		suspended if using public terminals to access sexually explicit websites. Repeat offenses will result in
		revocation of Internet privileges.</p>

	<p>This policy is subject to change without notice.</p>
