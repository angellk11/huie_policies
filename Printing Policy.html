    <p>Students may print to a black and white laser printer from any student computer terminal. The library uses a
        print management software to manage student printing balance.</p>

    <h4>Student Balances</h4>

    <p>A balance of 500 pages is added to each student account per semester: Fall, Spring, Summer. Students may also
        save 50% on print jobs by choosing to print on both sides of the paper and help reduce paper use (Please note
        that duplex printing is only available on the printers on the 1st and 2nd floor of the library). </p>

    <p>Students may purchase additional prints at the Circulation Desk for $0.05 per page.</p>

        the Reference Desk on a flash drive and will need to pay in cash.</p>

    <p>Photographs must be formatted and contained to one document prior to printing request.</p>
