    <h2>Collection Development Policy</h2>

    <p>Huie Library derives its objectives from the goals of the University and fulfills these through its services and
        collections. The Library's primary function is to develop and maintain a collection of materials which meets
        instructional and basic research needs of the students and faculty of Henderson State University. In addition to
        its primary clientele, the Library provides services to the people of southwestern Arkansas.</p>

    <p>The purposes of this policy are to provide guidance in developing library collections and to communicate
        collection development goals and objectives to the University community. This policy will be reviewed at regular
        intervals in response to changing University needs.</p>

    <h4>Selection Responsibilities</h4>

    <p>Faculty members share responsibility with librarians for the selection of materials which directly support their
        teaching areas, academic fields, and related research needs. The faculty may also recommend materials which they
        feel will contribute to the overall excellence of the Library's collections. Materials related to personal
        research are requested through interlibrary loan.</p>

    <p>It is the responsibility of the Library faculty to oversee the selection of materials and the final decision
        rests with the Library faculty. Each Library faculty member coordinates collection development for assigned
        academic departments and serves as liaison to these departments.</p>

    <h4>Gifts</h4>

    <p>Gifts may be accepted for the Library on behalf of the University. Gift materials must be judged useful to the
        collection before they are added. Unsolicited materials are added or disposed of at the Library's discretion.
        Donors may submit a list of titles for preview by a Technical Services Coordinator; otherwise, gift materials
        not added to the collection are sold at a book sale or disposed of by methods approved by the State of Arkansas.
        Donors will not receive acknowledgement for gifts unless specifically requested. In some cases, book plates with
        the donor's name will be placed in the item(s) added to the collection.</p>

    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>

    <p>Foreign language materials are acquired for appropriate courses; otherwise, materials are acquired in English.
        Huie Library does not acquire duplicate copies of materials, although exceptions may be made. Lost or damaged
        titles are considered for replacement according to the following criteria: value to the collection, existing
        coverage of the subject in the collection, availability of newer or better materials on the subject. Popular
        fiction and DVD's are generally not replaced.</p>

    <h4>Replacements</h4>

    <p>Replacements are ordered by the Coordinator of Technical Services upon the recommendation of the subject
        specialist librarian. When appropriate, the replacement should be an exact copy, a new impression, or new
        printing of the original work. A later or revised edition of the original work may be substituted when it is
        considered more desirable.</p>

    <h4>Rebinding</h4>

    <p>Rebinding considerations are based on the value and use of the title, possibility of replacement, physical
        condition, and the cost of rebinding vs. cost of a replacement.</p>

    <h4>Material Format</h4>

    <p>Books/monographs are normally collected in clothbound editions. The library also purchases eBooks. Textbooks,
        workbooks, study guides, etc., translations of English titles into foreign languages, or of foreign titles
        translated into non-English languages are collected only by exception. Books of a popular nature or self-help
        books are collected only in limited quantities. Kits and other unbound selections are generally not collected.
        We collect video materials which are expected to be of significant long-term value in support of teaching or
        research. Academy Award-winning movies are also collected. Popular movies, including Award-winning movies, are
        generally not replaced when damaged. Huie Library acquires non-print materials in the most appropriate and
        current format. For examples, VHS tapes will not be purchased if a DVD edition is available.</p>

    <h4>Evaluation and Weeding of Monographs</h4>

    <p>The purpose of evaluation is to maintain a current, active, and useful collection which reflects the goals of the
        Library and Henderson State University. Evaluation of the collection takes place continuously. Archival
        materials and special works (such as works by local authors) are not considered for withdrawal.</p>

    <p>The following guidelines specify evaluation factors. No single factor should be used; rather, a combination of
        factors, including age, use patterns, content, physical condition, superfluous or duplicate materials, and
        circulation.</p>

    <p>Exceptions to these criteria are: classic or seminal works, titles on standardized lists, expensive art and
        geographic works, works indexed in reference sources, and biographical and historical works.</p>

    <h4>Curriculum Collection</h4>

    <p>The purpose of the Curriculum Collection is to make available textbooks in subject areas for grades K-12, with an
        emphasis on subjects taught in the Teachers College.</p>

    <h4>Juvenile and Young Adult Collections</h4>

    <p>The primary purpose of the Juvenile and Young Adult Collections is to support the Teachers College with an
        emphasis on the children's literature courses. The collection provides reading material appropriate for
        preschoolers through young adults. Selection criteria include quality books, Award winners (e.g. Newberry,
        Caldecott, Charlie Mae Simon, Coretta Scott King, etc.), and honor books.</p>

    <h4>Serials Collection</h4>

    <p>Acquisitions of serial materials require a higher degree of selectivity than do monographs due to annual
        subscription prices and cost of binding and storage. Huie Library prefers an electronic to a print version of a
        journal whenever possible. Two exceptions are titles for which the online lacks an important component of the
        print version and titles in the Library's popular magazine collection. The serial should be indexed or
        abstracted by services available in the Library. For serials not indexed, serious consideration must be given to
        the timeliness of the subject and whether class assignments require their use. Expensive or little-used serials
        should be accessed via interlibrary loan. Any serials subject to a significant increase in cost will be
        re-evaluated. A few area and national newspapers are purchased. With the exception of the Daily Siftings Herald,
        local papers are donated.</p>

    <h4>Evaluation and Weeding of Serials</h4>

    <p>Serials are evaluated more conservatively than are monographs due to their cost and the variety needed to
        adequately support the curriculum.</p>

    <p>The following criteria are used for evaluation and weeding: broken files, un-indexed materials, extremely short
        runs, titles in curricular areas no longer taught at the University, or serials in print or microfilm format
        that are available online.</p>

    <p>Complaints concerning the collections of Huie Library should be submitted in writing to the Library Director.</p>
