    <h2>Library Instruction Policy</h2>

    <p>Huie Library offers Library Instruction sessions in an effort to help students gain a clearer understanding of
        the research process and the resources available to them. Library Instruction is provided for the groups listed
        below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Henderson State University courses.</li>
        <li>Area high school classes 10th grade and above. There can be no more than 25 students per session, and there
            must be at least two adults with the group.</li>
        <li>Groups not falling within the above parameters will be considered on an individual basis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are interested in offering a Library Instruction session to your students, please contact:</p>

    <p>Natalie Scrimshire, <a href="mailto:scrimsn@hsu.edu">scrimsn@hsu.edu</a> or Linda Evans, <a
            href="mailto:evansl@hsu.edu">evansl@hsu.edu</a></p>

    <p>Arrangements for Library Instruction must be made at least one week in advance and receive approval from the
        Librarians. If possible, high school orientations should be scheduled very early in the semester before college
        courses resume.</p>

    <p>High school students may check out two books each on their teacher's library account. The teacher must have an
        ID/library card and his or her card must be in good standing. Books may be checked out for 28 days with no
        renewals.</p>
